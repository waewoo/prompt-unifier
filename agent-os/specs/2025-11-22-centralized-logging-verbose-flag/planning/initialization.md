# Raw Idea: Centralized Logging & Verbose Flag

## Feature Description

**Centralized Logging & Verbose Flag** — Add a centralized logging system and a global --verbose flag for debugging. This completes the Error Handling, Logging & User Feedback feature (item 13 in roadmap). The comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages is already implemented.

## Requirements from Roadmap

- Centralized logging system for consistent log output
- Global --verbose flag that can be used with any command
- Debug-level logging for troubleshooting

## Context

This feature is part of roadmap item 13: Error Handling, Logging & User Feedback. The comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages is already implemented; this spec addresses the remaining logging and verbose flag components.
