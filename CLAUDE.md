### 🧠 MEMORY MANAGEMENT

The single source of truth for Project Context and Agent Definitions is the file @AGENTS.md .

- **Reading**: Always refer to the content of @AGENTS.md first to understand active agents and
  project rules.
- **Writing**: If you learn something new about the project, or if the user asks to "update the
  rules/context", YOU MUST UPDATE @AGENTS.md .
