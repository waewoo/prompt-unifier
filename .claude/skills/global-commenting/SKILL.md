name: Global Commenting
description: Write clear, meaningful code comments that explain the 'why' rather than the 'what', focusing on complex logic, business rules, and non-obvious decisions while keeping self-documenting code where possible. Use this skill when adding comments to code across all languages, when documenting complex algorithms or business logic, when explaining non-obvious decisions or workarounds, when adding TODO or FIXME comments, when writing inline documentation, or when reviewing code that needs clarifying comments. Apply when commenting complex functions, when explaining business rules, when documenting edge cases, when adding context for future maintainers, or when removing outdated or unnecessary comments.

- When explaining non-obvious design decisions or architectural choices
- When adding TODO, FIXME, HACK, or similar marker comments
- When writing inline documentation for complex code sections
- When reviewing code that needs clarifying comments for maintainability
- When commenting on complex functions that aren't self-evident
- When explaining business rules or domain-specific logic
- When documenting edge cases or unusual scenarios
- When adding context for future developers or maintainers
- When removing outdated, misleading, or unnecessary comments
- When explaining workarounds for bugs or limitations
- When documenting assumptions or preconditions
