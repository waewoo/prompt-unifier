description: Build reusable, modular frontend components following component-based architecture with proper props, state management, lifecycle methods, and composition patterns. Use this skill when creating React, Vue, or other framework components, when implementing component logic and rendering, when managing component state and props, when organizing component structure and hierarchy, when creating presentational or container components, or when implementing component composition and reusability. Apply when working with .jsx, .tsx, .vue, or component files, when handling component events and callbacks, when implementing hooks or lifecycle methods, when creating custom hooks or composables, or when building component libraries.

- When creating presentational (dumb) or container (smart) components
- When implementing component composition, inheritance, or reusability patterns
- When working with `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, or component files
- When handling component events, callbacks, and event handlers
- When implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) or lifecycle methods
- When creating custom hooks, composables, or utility functions for components
