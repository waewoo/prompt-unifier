name: Testing Best Practices
description: Follow comprehensive testing best practices including test-driven development (TDD), writing isolated and deterministic tests, proper test organization, meaningful assertions, and mocking external dependencies. Use this skill when writing any test files, when implementing test-driven development workflows, when organizing test suites, when creating test fixtures and setup, when mocking dependencies, when writing assertions, or when ensuring tests are maintainable and reliable. Apply when working with test files (test_*.py, *.test.js, *.spec.ts), when following TDD red-green-refactor cycle, when using test frameworks, when creating test utilities, or when reviewing test code quality.

# Testing Best Practices

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing best practices.

## When to use this skill

- When writing any test files in any testing framework
- When implementing test-driven development (TDD) workflows and red-green-refactor cycles
- When organizing test suites, test cases, and test files
- When creating test fixtures, setup, teardown, and test utilities
- When mocking external dependencies, services, or APIs in tests
- When writing clear, meaningful test assertions and expectations
- When ensuring tests are isolated, deterministic, and reliable
- When working with test files (`test_*.py`, `*.test.js`, `*.spec.ts`, etc.)
- When following the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) test pattern
- When using test frameworks (pytest, Jest, Mocha, etc.)
- When creating test utilities, helpers, or shared fixtures
- When reviewing test code quality and maintainability
- When refactoring tests to improve clarity or reduce duplication
