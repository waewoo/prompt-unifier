name: Global Validation
description: Implement robust input validation and data validation at multiple layers including frontend, backend, and database with clear error messages and security considerations to ensure data integrity. Use this skill when validating user inputs in forms, when implementing API request validation, when adding model or schema validation, when validating data before database operations, when implementing business rule validation, or when providing validation error feedback. Apply when using validation libraries (Pydantic, Joi, Yup), when writing validation logic, when handling validation errors, when validating at system boundaries, or when ensuring data integrity across layers.

# Global Validation

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global validation.

## When to use this skill

- When validating user inputs in forms, fields, or interactive components
- When implementing API request validation for endpoints and routes
- When adding model or schema validation using Pydantic, marshmallow, etc.
- When validating data before database insert, update, or delete operations
- When implementing business rule validation and domain constraints
- When providing clear, user-friendly validation error messages
- When using validation libraries (Pydantic, Joi, Yup, Zod, validator.js)
- When writing custom validation logic or validators
- When handling and displaying validation errors to users
- When validating data at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- When ensuring data integrity and consistency across application layers
- When implementing server-side validation to complement client-side validation
- When validating file uploads, data formats, or structured data
