name: Testing Makefile Testing
description: Configure and use Makefile targets for running tests, including test commands, test environment setup, test filtering, and test reporting through make test, make coverage, and related commands. Use this skill when working with Makefile test targets, when creating test automation commands, when setting up test environments via make, when running specific test suites or modules, when configuring test output and reporting, or when integrating tests into build workflows. Apply when adding or modifying Makefile test rules, when running make test or make coverage commands, when setting up test dependencies, or when automating test execution.

# Testing Makefile Testing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing makefile testing.

## When to use this skill

- When working with `Makefile` test targets and test-related make rules
- When creating test automation commands like `make test`, `make coverage`, `make test-unit`
- When setting up test environments and test dependencies via Makefile
- When running specific test suites, modules, or test files through make commands
- When configuring test output formatting and test reporting
- When integrating tests into build workflows and CI/CD pipelines
- When adding or modifying Makefile test rules and targets
- When running `make test`, `make coverage`, or similar test commands
- When setting up test prerequisites, test databases, or test fixtures
- When automating test execution with different configurations or flags
- When creating shortcuts for common testing workflows
- When organizing test commands for different test types (unit, integration, e2e)
