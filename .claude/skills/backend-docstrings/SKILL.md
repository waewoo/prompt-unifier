name: Backend Docstrings
description: Write clear, comprehensive docstrings for Python modules, classes, functions, and methods following Google or NumPy style conventions. Use this skill when writing or modifying Python backend files (.py), when creating new functions, classes, or methods, when adding documentation to existing code, when working on public APIs that need clear documentation, or when implementing complex business logic that requires explanation. Apply when documenting function parameters and return types, when explaining class purposes and attributes, when describing module-level functionality, when adding usage examples to docstrings, or when documenting exceptions that may be raised.
