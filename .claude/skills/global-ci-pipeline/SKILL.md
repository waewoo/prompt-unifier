name: Global CI Pipeline
description: Configure and maintain continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with automated testing, linting, building, and deployment workflows across all environments. Use this skill when working with CI/CD configuration files like .gitlab-ci.yml, .github/workflows, Jenkinsfile, or similar pipeline definitions, when setting up automated testing in CI, when configuring build and deployment stages, when managing CI/CD environment variables and secrets, when optimizing pipeline performance, or when troubleshooting CI/CD failures. Apply when creating workflow jobs and steps, when configuring test runners in CI, when setting up deployment to staging or production, when implementing caching strategies, or when managing pipeline dependencies and artifacts.

# Global CI Pipeline

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global ci pipeline.

## When to use this skill

- When working with CI/CD configuration files (`.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/`, `Jenkinsfile`, etc.)
- When setting up automated testing, linting, and type checking in CI pipelines
- When configuring build stages for compilation, bundling, or packaging
- When setting up deployment stages to staging, production, or other environments
- When managing CI/CD environment variables, secrets, and configuration
- When optimizing pipeline performance with caching, parallelization, or artifacts
- When troubleshooting CI/CD job failures or build errors
- When creating workflow jobs, stages, and steps in pipeline definitions
- When configuring test runners (pytest, Jest, etc.) to run in CI environments
- When implementing deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
- When managing pipeline dependencies, Docker images, or build tools
- When setting up notifications, badges, or reporting for CI/CD status
