name: Global Dependency Management
description: Manage project dependencies, package versions, lock files, and dependency resolution across all package managers including npm, yarn, pip, Poetry, and others with proper version pinning and security considerations. Use this skill when working with package.json, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, package-lock.json, poetry.lock, or yarn.lock files, when adding, updating, or removing dependencies, when resolving dependency conflicts, when managing dev vs production dependencies, when auditing security vulnerabilities, or when optimizing dependency trees. Apply when installing packages, when updating lock files, when handling peer dependencies, when configuring package registries, or when dealing with monorepo dependency management.

# Global Dependency Management

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global dependency management.

## When to use this skill

- When working with `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, or dependency manifests
- When working with lock files (`package-lock.json`, `poetry.lock`, `yarn.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`)
- When adding, updating, or removing project dependencies
- When resolving dependency conflicts or version incompatibilities
- When managing development vs production vs optional dependency groups
- When auditing dependencies for security vulnerabilities
- When optimizing dependency trees and removing unused packages
- When installing third-party packages or libraries
- When updating lock files after dependency changes
- When handling peer dependencies or transitive dependencies
- When configuring package registries, scoped packages, or private repositories
- When managing monorepo dependencies with workspaces or similar tools
- When pinning dependency versions for reproducible builds
