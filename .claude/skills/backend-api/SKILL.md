name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following REST principles with clear resource-based URLs and appropriate HTTP methods. Use this skill when creating or modifying API endpoint files, route handlers, controllers that define HTTP endpoints, API versioning logic, request/response formatting middleware, or any backend files that expose HTTP interfaces to clients. Apply when working on files in api/, routes/, controllers/, endpoints/, or views/ directories, when implementing REST resources, when adding new HTTP endpoints, when modifying existing API routes, when working with FastAPI/Flask route decorators, when handling HTTP status codes and responses, when implementing API authentication/authorization, when adding query parameter handling, or when configuring API middleware.

# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.

## When to use this skill

- When creating or modifying API endpoint files (e.g., `api/v1/users.py`, `routes/products.py`)
- When working with route handlers or controllers that define HTTP endpoints
- When implementing API versioning logic or version-specific endpoints
- When adding or modifying request/response formatting middleware
- When working on files in `api/`, `routes/`, `controllers/`, `endpoints/`, or `views/` directories
- When implementing REST resources with CRUD operations
- When adding new HTTP endpoints to expose backend functionality
- When modifying existing API routes or changing endpoint behavior
- When working with FastAPI, Flask, or Django route decorators and path operations
- When handling HTTP status codes and API responses
- When implementing API authentication or authorization middleware
- When adding query parameter handling for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When configuring API middleware or request/response interceptors
