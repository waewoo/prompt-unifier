name: Global Build System
description: Configure and maintain build systems, build tools, and build scripts for compiling, bundling, transpiling, and packaging applications across frontend and backend. Use this skill when working with Makefile, package.json scripts, webpack.config.js, vite.config.ts, build scripts, or build configuration files, when setting up compilation or transpilation processes, when configuring bundlers or module loaders, when optimizing build performance, when managing build environments and modes, or when troubleshooting build errors. Apply when creating or modifying build commands, when configuring asset optimization, when setting up source maps, when managing build outputs, or when implementing watch mode or hot reloading.

# Global Build System

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global build system.

## When to use this skill

- When working with `Makefile`, `package.json` scripts, or build automation files
- When configuring webpack, Vite, Rollup, esbuild, or other bundlers
- When setting up compilation, transpilation (Babel, TypeScript), or build processes
- When optimizing build performance with caching, code splitting, or tree shaking
- When managing build environments (development, production, staging) and modes
- When troubleshooting build errors, failed compilations, or bundling issues
- When creating or modifying build commands and scripts
- When configuring asset optimization (minification, compression, image optimization)
- When setting up source maps for debugging production builds
- When managing build outputs, dist folders, or compiled artifacts
- When implementing watch mode, hot module replacement (HMR), or live reloading
- When configuring build plugins, loaders, or transformers
