name: Global Coding Style
description: Follow consistent coding style conventions across all languages including naming, formatting, indentation, and code organization to maintain readability and consistency throughout the codebase. Use this skill when writing code in any language (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.), when refactoring code for consistency, when applying automated formatters and linters, when organizing code structure, when naming variables, functions, classes, or files, when removing dead code, or when ensuring code follows DRY principles. Apply to all code files regardless of language, when running formatters like Black, Prettier, or Ruff, when reviewing code style issues, when organizing imports or modules, or when keeping functions small and focused.

# Global Coding Style

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.

## When to use this skill

- When writing code in any programming language (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
- When refactoring existing code for consistency and maintainability
- When applying automated code formatters (Black, Prettier, Ruff, ESLint)
- When organizing code structure, modules, and file hierarchy
- When naming variables, functions, classes, methods, or files
- When removing dead code, commented blocks, or unused imports
- When ensuring code follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- When working on any code file regardless of the specific language
- When running linters or formatters to fix style issues
- When reviewing code and identifying style inconsistencies
- When organizing import statements or module dependencies
- When keeping functions small, focused, and following single responsibility principle
- When applying consistent indentation (spaces vs tabs) across the codebase
