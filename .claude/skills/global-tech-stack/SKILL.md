name: Global Tech Stack
description: Understand and work within the project's technology stack including frameworks, libraries, tools, languages, and platforms to ensure all code aligns with the chosen technologies and their best practices. Use this skill when making technology choices, when adding new dependencies or tools, when ensuring code follows framework conventions, when integrating with existing tech stack, when evaluating technology tradeoffs, or when maintaining consistency with project's technical architecture. Apply when working with any project code, when selecting libraries or packages, when following framework-specific patterns, when integrating third-party services, or when ensuring compatibility across the stack.

# Global Tech Stack

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global tech stack.

## When to use this skill

- When making technology choices or selecting frameworks and libraries
- When adding new dependencies, tools, or third-party integrations
- When ensuring code follows framework-specific conventions and best practices
- When integrating new features with the existing technology stack
- When evaluating technology tradeoffs and architectural decisions
- When maintaining consistency with the project's technical architecture
- When working with any project code across frontend, backend, or infrastructure
- When selecting appropriate libraries or packages for new features
- When following framework-specific patterns (Django, React, FastAPI, etc.)
- When integrating third-party services (APIs, authentication, payments)
- When ensuring compatibility and interoperability across the stack
- When documenting technology decisions and architectural choices
