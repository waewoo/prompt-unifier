name: Backend Style
description: Follow consistent Python coding style conventions including PEP 8 standards, naming conventions, code formatting, and best practices for backend code. Use this skill when writing or refactoring Python backend files (.py), when formatting code for consistency, when naming variables, functions, classes, or modules, when organizing imports, when applying code formatting rules, or when ensuring code readability and maintainability. Apply when working on any Python backend code, when running linters like Ruff or Black, when reviewing code style issues, when applying snake_case naming, when organizing code structure, or when removing dead code and unused imports.

# Backend Style

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend style.

## When to use this skill

- When writing or refactoring any Python backend files with `.py` extension
- When formatting code for consistency across the codebase
- When naming variables, functions, classes, or modules
- When organizing and sorting import statements
- When applying automated code formatting with tools like Ruff or Black
- When ensuring code readability and maintainability
- When reviewing and fixing code style issues reported by linters
- When applying `snake_case` naming conventions for functions and variables
- When applying `PascalCase` naming for classes
- When organizing code structure and module layout
- When removing dead code, commented-out blocks, and unused imports
- When applying consistent indentation (spaces vs tabs)
- When keeping functions small and focused on single tasks
- When following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
