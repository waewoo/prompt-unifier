name: Testing Coverage
description: Measure, analyze, and improve test coverage using coverage tools to ensure adequate testing of code paths, branches, and statements while maintaining meaningful test quality over coverage metrics. Use this skill when running coverage reports, when analyzing uncovered code paths, when setting coverage thresholds and goals, when identifying areas needing more tests, when configuring coverage tools, or when reviewing coverage metrics in CI/CD. Apply when using coverage tools (pytest-cov, Istanbul, nyc), when generating coverage reports, when improving test coverage, when setting minimum coverage requirements, or when excluding files from coverage analysis.

# Testing Coverage

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing coverage.

## When to use this skill

- When running test coverage reports to measure code coverage
- When analyzing uncovered code paths, branches, and statements
- When setting coverage thresholds, goals, and minimum requirements
- When identifying areas of code that need additional test coverage
- When configuring coverage tools and coverage settings
- When reviewing coverage metrics in CI/CD pipelines
- When using coverage tools (pytest-cov, coverage.py, Istanbul, nyc, c8)
- When generating HTML, XML, or JSON coverage reports
- When improving test coverage by adding tests for uncovered code
- When setting minimum coverage requirements for pull requests
- When excluding files or directories from coverage analysis
- When interpreting coverage reports and identifying gaps
- When balancing coverage metrics with meaningful test quality
