name: Backend Python Packages
description: Manage Python package dependencies, requirements, and virtual environments using Poetry, pip, or other dependency management tools with proper version pinning and dependency resolution. Use this skill when working with pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, or Poetry lock files, when adding or removing package dependencies, when updating dependency versions, when resolving dependency conflicts, when configuring development vs production dependencies, or when setting up virtual environments. Apply when installing new packages, when managing dependency groups, when updating the lock file, when handling transitive dependencies, or when configuring package sources and indexes.
