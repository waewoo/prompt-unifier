name: Backend Project Structure
description: Organize backend code following a clear, modular architecture with proper separation of concerns across directories like models/, services/, api/, utils/, and tests/. Use this skill when creating new directories or modules in the backend, when organizing code into logical layers, when deciding where to place new files, when refactoring project structure, when setting up new backend projects, or when ensuring code follows established architectural patterns. Apply when creating new Python packages or modules, when organizing business logic into service layers, when separating data access from business logic, when structuring API endpoints and controllers, or when maintaining clean architecture boundaries.

# Backend Project Structure

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend project structure.

## When to use this skill

- When creating new directories or modules in the backend codebase
- When organizing code into logical layers (presentation, business, data)
- When deciding where to place new files or modules
- When refactoring existing project structure for better organization
- When setting up new backend projects or initializing project scaffolding
- When ensuring code follows established architectural patterns (MVC, layered, clean architecture)
- When creating new Python packages with `__init__.py` files
- When organizing business logic into service layer classes
- When separating data access logic from business logic
- When structuring API endpoints, controllers, and route handlers
- When maintaining clean architecture boundaries and dependencies
- When organizing utility functions, helpers, and shared code
- When setting up configuration, constants, or settings modules
