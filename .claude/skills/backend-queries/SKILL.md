name: Backend Queries
description: Write efficient, secure database queries using ORM query builders or raw SQL with proper optimization, indexing considerations, and protection against SQL injection. Use this skill when writing database queries in repository files, service layer methods, or data access objects, when using SQLAlchemy query API or Django ORM querysets, when optimizing database performance, when implementing complex joins or aggregations, when adding filtering or search functionality, or when working with database transactions. Apply when writing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations, when using query filters and conditions, when implementing pagination or cursor-based navigation, when eager loading relationships to avoid N+1 queries, or when writing raw SQL queries.

# Backend Queries

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend queries.

## When to use this skill

- When using SQLAlchemy query API, Django ORM, or other ORM querysets
- When optimizing database query performance and reducing query count
- When implementing complex database joins, aggregations, or subqueries
- When adding filtering, searching, or sorting functionality
- When working with database transactions and connection management
- When writing SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations
- When using query filters, conditions, and WHERE clauses
- When implementing pagination, limit/offset, or cursor-based navigation
- When eager loading relationships to avoid N+1 query problems
- When writing raw SQL queries for complex or performance-critical operations
- When adding database indexes to improve query performance
- When implementing full-text search or advanced search features
