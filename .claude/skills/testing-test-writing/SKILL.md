name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write clear, focused, and maintainable tests following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern with descriptive test names, meaningful assertions, proper test isolation, and comprehensive coverage of happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions. Use this skill when writing individual test cases, when structuring test logic, when naming test functions, when writing test assertions, when testing different scenarios and edge cases, when organizing test setup and teardown, or when ensuring tests are readable and maintainable. Apply when creating new test functions, when testing business logic, when testing error handling, when writing integration or unit tests, or when refactoring existing tests.

# Testing Test Writing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.

## When to use this skill

- When writing individual test cases and test functions
- When structuring test logic following Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- When naming test functions descriptively (test_should_do_something_when_condition)
- When writing clear, meaningful test assertions and expectations
- When testing different scenarios including happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions
- When organizing test setup, teardown, and cleanup logic
- When ensuring tests are readable, maintainable, and self-documenting
- When creating new test functions for features or bug fixes
- When testing business logic, algorithms, or complex calculations
- When testing error handling, exceptions, and validation
- When writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests
- When refactoring existing tests to improve clarity or reliability
- When ensuring each test focuses on testing one specific behavior
